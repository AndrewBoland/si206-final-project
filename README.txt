# What option?
##################################################
Option 2

# What does it do?
##################################################
This program uses a list of movies and gathers information about the movies, it then gets tweets about the top paid actors in the movies and stores all of that information into a database. The database is then used to query interesting intersections of information about the movie and tweets. No input is needed.

# How to run it?
##################################################
Run the command: python 206_final_project.py

# What are the dependencies?
##################################################
* A twitter_info.py file containing your consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret, all gathered from twitter

# Data Manipulation Descriptions
##################################################
What else does the code do?
    *The code also uses many different structures throughout to gather the data in meaningful ways, such as using dictionaries to store actor, movie pairs and lists to store instances of movies for future database population.
How is it useful?
    *This code is useful for gathering all of the information into usable structures that allow database insertion to be simpler and more meaningful
What will it show you?
    *This program will show you interesting data about relevant actors (judged by the amount of retweets about them), popular tweets about those actors in good movies. It will show you the users most favorited tweets about these actors, the most common characters used in these tweets and the most active users in the created database (judged by the number of favorites they have made)
What should a user expect?
    *The user should expect an output file containing all of the above information in a nicley formatted, readable output

# Why did I choose this project?
##################################################
I wanted to be able to see data about some of my favorite movies and use that in combination with Twitter to see which actors from those movies are still relevant in the eyes of Twitter users
